Introduction
MongoDBâ€™s explain() provides details about how a query is executed. It helps in understanding:
- Index efficiency
- Execution plans
- Bottlenecks in performance

---

Why Use explain()?
Using explain(), you can identify:
- Whether your query uses an index
- The type of index used
- The number of documents scanned vs. returned

---

Key Commands

Basic Syntax
db.collection.find(query).explain();

Execution Stages
- queryPlanner: High-level overview of the query plan.
- executionStats: Detailed statistics on query execution.
- allPlansExecution: All possible query plans considered.

Examples

Simple Query Explanation
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }).explain("executionStats");

Output:
{
  "queryPlanner": { ... },
  "executionStats": {
    "nReturned": 100,
    "totalKeysExamined": 200,
    "totalDocsExamined": 300
  }
}

Using Indexes
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 });
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }).explain();
